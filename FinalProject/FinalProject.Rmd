This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
ufc_stats
```
- create a csv file, just in case
```{r}
write.csv(ufc_stats,file="ufc_stats.csv")
```

Who has the most significant strikes in UFC? 
```{r}
ufc_stats %>% group_by(fighter) %>%
  summarise(total_significant_strikes = sum(significant_strikes_landed)) %>%
  arrange(-total_significant_strikes) %>%
  head()
```
Best KOer

```{r}
ufc_stats %>%
  group_by(fighter) %>%
  summarise(knockdown_rate = sum(knockdowns) / sum(significant_strikes_attempted)) %>%
  arrange(desc(knockdown_rate)) %>%
  head()
```

```{r}
ufc_stats %>%
  group_by(fighter) %>%
  summarise(striking_efficiency = sum(significant_strikes_landed) / sum(significant_strikes_attempted)) %>%
  arrange(desc(striking_efficiency)) %>%
  head()
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
