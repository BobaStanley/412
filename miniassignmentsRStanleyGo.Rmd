This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
#CTRL+ALT+ i makes a chunk 
```{r}
plot(cars)
```
```{r}
x <- 2+2
```
```{r}
help()
```


```{r}
2+2
```
Write a function that takes a positive number and makes it negative
```{r}
make_negative <- function(x){
  abs(x)*(-1)
}
```
```{r}
make_negative(-3)
```

```{r}
favenumber <- 8
```
```{r}
?sd

```
```{r}
sd(1:2)^2
```
#doesntwork
 
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
create a new code chunk 
```{r}

```{r}
my_first_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
my_second_vector <- c(3, 4, 5)
my_second_vector 
```
```{r}
my_list <- list(my_first_vector, my_second_vector)
my_list
```
```{r}
as.data.frame(my_list)

```{r}
x <- 10
if (x < 10){
  print("low")
}else if (x>=10 && x<=20){

}

```
Make a for loop that takes a vector of names and prints “Hi NAME” (NAME meaning the names from the vector) for each element of the vector.

```{r}
names <- c("John", "joe", "Stan")
for(name in names){
  message <- paste("Hi", names)
  print(message)
}

```
Make a while loop that samples one name from the vector of names, adds it to a new vector (but only if that name hasn’t already been added), and stops when each name is in the new list at least once.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
