This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
#CTRL+ALT+ i makes a chunk 
```{r}
plot(cars)
```
```{r}
x <- 2+2
```
```{r}
help()
```


```{r}
2+2
```
Write a function that takes a positive number and makes it negative
```{r}
make_negative <- function(x){
  abs(x)*(-1)
}
```
```{r}
make_negative(-3)
```

```{r}
favenumber <- 8
```
```{r}
?sd

```
```{r}
sd(1:2)^2
```
#doesntwork
 
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
create a new code chunk 
```{r}
(7*8) <= make_negative(56)|| TRUE



```

```{r}
my_first_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
my_second_vector <- c(3, 4, 5)
my_second_vector 
```
```{r}
my_list <- list(my_first_vector, my_second_vector)
my_list
```
```{r}
as.data.frame(my_list)
```
```{r}
x <- 10
if (x < 10){
  print("low")
}else if (x>=10 && x<=20){
  print("medium")
}else{
  print("high")
}

```
Make a for loop that takes a vector of names and prints “Hi NAME” (NAME meaning the names from the vector) for each element of the vector.

```{r}
names <- c("John", "joe", "Stan")
for(name in names){
  message <- paste("Hi", names)
  print(message)
}

```
Make a while loop that samples one name from the vector of names, adds it to a new vector (but only if that name hasn’t already been added), and stops when each name is in the new list at least once.

```{r}

```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
